                <p>
                    The Mighty Ducks Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing
                    Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play hockey. To be a

                    neighborhood. MDHL ran by o small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of
                    parents and previous league members
